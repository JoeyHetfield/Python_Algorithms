# Python Algorithm Challenges

### Description
This project contains a collection of Python algorithms implemented as part of the learning process during my time as a student at Trybe. Each algorithm focuses on a different problem and showcases various programming concepts and techniques

The algorithms included in this project are:

1 - Number of students studying at the same time (Search Algorithm)  
2 - Inversion Encryption (Test-Driven Development)  
3 - Palindromes (Recursion)  
4 - Anagrams (Sorting Algorithm)  
5 - Finding Duplicate Numbers (Search Algorithm)  
6 - Palindromes (Iterative Approach)  

The project provides an opportunity for others to clone and explore the algorithms. It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment for testing and running the project.

## Installation
To clone the project and set up the virtual environment, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

>   git clone git@github.com:JoeyHetfield/Python_Algorithms.git

Change into the project directory and create a virtual environment:

>  python3 -m venv .venv
>  
Activate the virtual environment:

> source .venv/bin/activate


Install the dependencies in the virtual environment:


> python3 -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt


## Usage
Running the Tests
To execute the tests, ensure that you have the virtual environment activated.

Run the following command:

> python3 -m pytest
> 
The tests will be run, and the results will be displayed in the console.
